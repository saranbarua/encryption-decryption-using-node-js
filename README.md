Web applications have access to large amounts of data that belongs to people, organizations, and governments. The more the data is accessed, the higher the threat to data security. In the software development industry, developers use cryptography and encryption techniques to protect sensitive data from malicious parties.

Cryptography is used to secure data stored in a database or transferred over a software development industry network. When handling, moving, and storing data, you must do it safely and securely.

Thus as a node.js developer, you should understand how to encrypt and decrypt data to secure data processed by your system. Node.js has a built-in library called crypto for data encryption and decryption.
